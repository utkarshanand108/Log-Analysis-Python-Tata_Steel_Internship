# Log-Analysis-Python-Tata_Steel_Internship

A data analysis project focused on log analysis and business insights, developed during a summer internship at Tata Steel (SNTI) under the mentorship of Tata Steel’s IT Department.

## Project Overview

This repository contains all code, analysis scripts, reports, and results for the **Log Analysis and Business Insights with Python** project. The aim was to analyze large-scale log files, extract actionable insights, visualize system and user metrics, and store results in a database using Python and modern data science tools.

## Context

- **Organization:** Tata Steel SNTI  
- **Intern:** Utkarsh Anand (VT20245542)  
- **Internship Duration:** 22 July 2024 – 24 October 2024  
- **Mentor:** Mr. Anup Kumar, IT Department

## Objectives

- Parse and analyze log files from diverse sources (system, application, user activity).  
- Extract insights such as error frequencies, user activity patterns, and peak usage times.  
- Export cleaned data and insights to CSV files.  
- Visualize key metrics for rapid interpretation.  
- Handle high-volume, multi-file processing efficiently.  
- Store parsed and analyzed data in a SQLite database.  
- Develop a simple web app (if included) for result presentation.

## Project Components

- Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for parsing, aggregation, and visualization  
- Sample data and log files (if included)  
- PDF reports for project and code documentation  
- Result CSVs, plots, and SQLite database files  
- This README and inline code documentation

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- sqlite3, re, json  
- os, glob, multiprocessing modules for file handling
